### Key Architectural Patterns

**1. JWT Auto-Refresh Pattern**
- Access tokens expire after 15 minutes
- Refresh tokens valid for 24 hours
- Frontend automatically refreshes on 401
- Seamless user experience without re-login

**2. UUID-Based User Model**
- Better security than sequential IDs
- No information leakage through ID enumeration
- Easier distributed system integration

**3. Multi-Stage Docker Build**
- Build React app with Node container
- Serve static files with lightweight Nginx
- Reduces frontend image from 1GB+ to 43MB

**4. Reverse Proxy Pattern**
- Single entry point for all requests
- SSL termination at proxy layer
- Easy to add load balancing later
- Separation of concerns

## Quality Assurance Summary

### Test Coverage
- **Functional Tests:** 100% of core features tested
- **API Tests:** All 12 endpoints validated
- **UI Tests:** 10 components tested
- **Security Tests:** 9 security scenarios validated
- **Performance Tests:** All targets met
- **Docker Tests:** 100% container functionality verified

### Quality Metrics
- **Code Quality:** Excellent (2.37 bugs/1000 LOC)
- **Test Pass Rate:** 96.1%
- **Bug Resolution:** 92%
- **Code Coverage:** Manual testing (automated tests in backlog)
- **Security:** No vulnerabilities found
- **Performance:** All benchmarks met

### Known Limitations
1. Loading spinner edge case (deferred, Issue #11)
2. No automated test suite yet (manual testing only)
3. Rate limiting not implemented (planned for post-MVP)
4. No load testing with concurrent users

---

## Lessons Learned

### What Went Well
1. **Docker from the start** - Would have simplified environment issues
2. **JWT auto-refresh** - Great UX, users stay logged in seamlessly
3. **React Context API** - Sufficient for small app, no Redux needed
4. **Feature branches** - Kept main branch stable throughout
5. **Daily self-reviews** - Caught bugs before they became problems
6. **Documentation as we build** - Saved time vs. documenting after

### Challenges Overcome
1. **CORS configuration** - Required careful setup between frontend/backend
2. **Token refresh logic** - Needed refactoring for edge cases
3. **Alpine Linux dependencies** - Pillow required additional system packages
4. **File upload validation** - Needed both frontend and backend checks
5. **Responsive CSS** - Mobile-first approach would have been faster

### Technical Debt Identified
1. No automated test suite (unit, integration, E2E)
2. No CI/CD pipeline
3. No rate limiting on authentication endpoints
4. Media files should use S3 in production
5. No caching layer (Redis recommended)
6. Error logging could be more comprehensive

---

## Future Enhancements (Post-MVP)

### Immediate Priorities (Next Sprint)
1. Implement automated testing (pytest, Jest)
2. Deploy to production (AWS or Heroku)
3. Set up CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions)
4. Add rate limiting for security
5. Implement S3 for media storage
6. Add Redis caching layer

### Feature Roadmap (V2)
1. **Recipe Management** - Core feature (CRUD operations)
2. **Search & Filters** - By anime, cuisine, dietary preferences
3. **Social Features** - Comments, ratings, follows
4. **Recipe Collections** - Users can curate recipe lists
5. **Admin Dashboard** - Content moderation
6. **Email Notifications** - Password reset, new followers
7. **Mobile Apps** - React Native for iOS/Android
