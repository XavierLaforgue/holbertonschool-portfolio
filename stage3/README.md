# Stage 3: Technical Documentation

Welcome to Stage 3 of the Portfolio Project! In this phase, project
objectives and requirements will be translated into a comprehensive technical plan for
building the MVP.

## Objectives
- Translate project objectives and requirements into a detailed technical plan.
- Define user stories and mockups to clarify functionality where applicable.
- Design and document architecture, components, classes, database structures, or collections as applicable.
- Create high-level sequence diagrams illustrating interactions between components or services.
- Specify external services (APIs) and define internal API endpoints with input and output formats.
- Plan source control management (SCM) and quality assurance (QA) strategies for code lifecycle and testing.
- Justify all technical decisions based on functional or non-functional requirements, constraints, or expert recommendations.

## Importance of Stage 3
This stage ensures the team creates a comprehensive blueprint for building the MVP. By planning technical aspects, source control, and quality assurance in advance, the team reduces risks, improves clarity, and enhances the development process. The documentation also aligns all stakeholders on the project's technical direction.

## Tasks to Complete Stage 3
Each task corresponds to a section of the Technical Documentation:

1. **Define User Stories and Mockups**
	- Write prioritized user stories using the format: "As a [user type], I want to [perform an action], so that [achieve a goal]."
	- Prioritize stories using MoSCoW (Must Have, Should Have, Could Have, Wonâ€™t Have).
	- Create mockups for main screens if applicable.

2. **Design System Architecture**
	- Create a high-level architecture diagram showing components such as front-end, back-end, databases, and external services.
	- Specify data flow between components.

3. **Define Components, Classes, and Database Design**
	- List and define key classes with their attributes and methods.
	- Create an ER diagram, database schema, or collection structure as applicable.
	- Outline main UI components and their interactions.

4. **Create High-Level Sequence Diagrams**
	- Draw sequence diagrams for 2-3 critical use cases, showing interactions between components.

5. **Document External and Internal APIs**
	- List external APIs used and reasons for selection.
	- Define internal API endpoints: URL path, HTTP method, input/output formats.

6. **Plan SCM and QA Strategies**
	- Define source control management processes (branching, code reviews).
	- Plan quality assurance strategies (testing tools, types of tests, deployment pipeline).

7. **Technical Justifications**
	- Provide rationales for chosen technologies and designs based on requirements and constraints.

## Deliverable: Technical Documentation
The Technical Documentation should include:
- **User Stories and Mockups:** Prioritized stories and mockups if applicable.
- **System Architecture:** High-level diagram.
- **Components, Classes, and Database Design:** ER diagram, database schema, or collection structure.
- **Sequence Diagrams:** Illustrating key interactions.
- **API Specifications:** External APIs and internal API endpoints.
- **SCM and QA Plans:** Strategies for source control and testing.
- **Technical Justifications:** Rationales for chosen technologies and designs.

## Expected Outcome
By the end of this stage, we should have:
- A comprehensive technical blueprint for the MVP.
- Clear documentation of user stories, architecture, components, APIs, and quality strategies.
- Justified technical decisions, ready for implementation in the next stage.
