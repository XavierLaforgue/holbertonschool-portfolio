# Portfolio project - Stage 1: Decision and refinement

## Selected MVP Concept
For practicality, as it ranked (in my opinion) highest in feasibility, challenges and risks (the last two meaning lower rank <-> higher challenge/risk), I chose the **Anime-inspired recipe-sharing site**.
### Rationale
Anime has currently a large fanbase, a fanbase in adulthood, facing
adult challenges such as preparing meals that are healthy and tasty
while also avoiding boredom/repetition.
This website could help tackle this issue by offering interesting and
community approved recipes.
### Potential impact
A community of curious anime fans wanting to experiment and create new
recipes inspired by their favorite shows may emerge.
Anime fans might be coherced to cook at home more often.
### Problem it solves
Meal planning and boredom related to meal prepping.
### Solution it provides
With community-generated recipes it simplifies meal planning and meal preparation.
The interactive steps and emotional connection to the anime that inspires the recipe will offer a measure of purpose and adventure, battling the boredom of prepariung a regular meal.
### Target audience
Fans of anime, home cooks looking for novelty.
### Kind of application
Web application.
### Why this idea over the others?
This idea ranked higher in feasibility, challenges and risks; meaning it was the most practical choice for a project with fix deadlines and not much leeway.
### Features and objectives of the MVP
A website where users can create an account and search for or share anime-inspired recipes.
Each recipe will dispose of step-by-step instructions, with or without
images for each step and a timer when one is necessary.
The quantities will be adapted according to the desired number of
portions.
Possibility to export the corresponding shopping list may be implemented.
### In-scope

### Risks, challenges, and mitigation
| Risk and challenges | Mitigation |
|---------------------|------------|
| lack of experience with certain tools | Start using the tools as early as possible to identify difficulties and look for assistance |
| Lack of technical expertise on selected technologies for development | Take time before execution to learn the technologies. Follow targeted tutorials |
| Unclear method of tracking progress in recipe preparation | Apply local storage solution and test for practicality |
