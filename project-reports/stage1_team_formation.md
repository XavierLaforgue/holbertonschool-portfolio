# Portfolio project - Stage 1: Team formation & roles definition
## Team members
This is a solo project.
## Roles
I will work alone and embody the role of a solo developer.
As a solo developer, I'll take on the multiple responsibilities that concern carrying a software development project to completion:
- Project manager (create plan, monitor project progression, identify and mitigate risks, correct plan and ensure deadlines are met).
- Team lead (coordinate tasks, make technical decisions, design technical architecture).
- Fullstack developer (develop software components, leverage free and low-cost services to deploy the application and streamline its delivery).
- UI designer (produce applicaton mock-ups)
- Source code manager (document code, create integration tests).
### External roles
I leverage the fact of following the Holberton School web development program to assign some roles to other members of the program:
- Students developing their own portfolio projects will serve as brainstorming partners and sources of feedback during ideation and decision-making.
- The local software developer will serve as technical advisor.
## Stakeholders
There are two main stakeholders: the pedagogical team and myself (both with a vested interest in the success of this project).
