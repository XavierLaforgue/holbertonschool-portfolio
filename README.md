# Holberton School Portfolio Project Repository

Welcome to my Portfolio Project repository!
This repository contains all stages of a comprehensive, multi-phase
project designed to guide students (such as myself) through the process of
building a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) from scratch.

## Project Overview

This project simulates a real-world software development environment,
emphasizing teamwork (when teams are made), technical execution, documentation, and project
management. 
Working iteratively, taking advantage of modern tools, and working in
the pursuit of a product with real practical use, students will
experience the full software development lifecycle, from ideation to
project closure.

### Objectives
- Develop critical technical and soft skills, including teamwork, communication, and problem-solving.
- Gain practical exposure to software design, architecture, and implementation.
- Learn effective project documentation and management.
- Understand the complete lifecycle of a product, preparing for professional challenges.

## Project Stages

1. **Stage 1: Team Formation and Idea Development (2 weeks)**
	- Form teams and collaboratively brainstorm/refine a project idea.
	- Focus on group dynamics, creativity, and alignment on a shared vision.

2. **Stage 2: Project Charter (2 weeks)**
	- Document project goals, scope, stakeholders, and risks.
	- Create a Project Charter as the foundation for the project.

3. **Stage 3: Technical Documentation (2 weeks)**
	- Develop detailed technical documentation, including class diagrams, system architecture, and workflows.
	- Ensure a solid technical plan for the MVP.

4. **Stage 4: MVP Development (4 weeks)**
	- Implement the MVP using modern technologies and best practices.
	- Emphasize code quality, teamwork, and iterative development.

5. **Stage 5: Project Closure (2 weeks)**
	- Prepare a final presentation and evaluate project outcomes.
	- Reflect on lessons learned and complete the MVP lifecycle.

## Why This Project?

This project is an opportunity to simulate professional software development practices, preparing students to thrive in collaborative and high-performance environments. Each phase builds on the previous one, fostering continuous learning and growth. Teams will not only learn technical skills but also practice effective communication and leadership, preparing them to excel in real-world projects.
