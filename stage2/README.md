# Stage 2: Team Formation and Idea Development

Welcome to Stage 1 of my Portfolio Project!
This phase is dedicated to building a strong team foundation and developing the concept for the Minimum Viable Product (MVP).

## Objectives
- Build cohesive and effective teams with clear communication and collaboration dynamics.
- Brainstorm and explore multiple project ideas while fostering creativity.
- Analyze and evaluate the feasibility of different ideas from technical and business perspectives.
- Select and define the MVP concept that aligns with the team’s interests, skills, and goals, or adapt to a pre-assigned MVP.
- Document the decision-making process, including the reasoning behind the selected idea.

## Tasks to Complete Stage 1
1. **Team Formation**
	- Hold an initial meeting to introduce team members, backgrounds, strengths, and interests.
	- Assign initial roles (e.g., temporary Project Manager).
	- Establish team norms for communication and collaboration (e.g., Slack, Discord, Teams).

2. **Research and Brainstorming**
	- Conduct individual and group research on potential project ideas.
	- Organize brainstorming sessions using techniques like Mind Mapping, SCAMPER, and “How Might We” questions.

3. **Idea Evaluation**
	- Define evaluation criteria (feasibility, impact, technical alignment, scalability).
	- Score and rank ideas using a rubric.
	- Identify risks and constraints for each idea.

4. **Decision and Refinement**
	- Select the final MVP idea based on team discussions and evaluation.
	- For pre-assigned MVPs, brainstorm enhancements or specific challenges.
	- Refine the concept: define the problem, target audience, key features, and expected outcomes.

5. **Documentation**
	- Document all ideas considered, including strengths, weaknesses, and reasons for rejection.
	- Summarize the selected MVP, rationale, and potential impact.
	- Provide an overview of team formation and the process followed.

## Deliverable: Stage 1 Report
Your Stage 1 Report should include:
- **Team Formation Overview:** Team member roles and collaboration strategies.
- **Ideas Explored:** Detailed descriptions of brainstormed ideas and reasons for rejection.
- **Selected MVP Concept:**
  - Summary of the chosen MVP
  - Reasons for selection (feasibility, innovation, alignment with goals)
  - Potential challenges and opportunities

## Expected Outcome
By the end of this stage, we should have:
- A well-defined MVP concept with a documented decision-making process.
- A cohesive and aligned team, ready for the next phase.
- A structured and detailed Stage 1 Report, setting the foundation for subsequent stages.
