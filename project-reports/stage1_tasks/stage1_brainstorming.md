## Evaluation criteria
Making emphasis on personal preference, feasibility and technical alignment with my current experience and the technologies I want to have had a first experience at at the end of the web developer's track, I reduced the themes to the most relevant and their main ideas.
| Theme | Concept |
|-------|---------|
| Sharing  | Share recipes, share learning roadmaps and ressources |
| Tracking | Track: watched shows, habits, tasks, perused learning ressource, home inventory |
| Planning | Plan meal preparation or shopping according to home inventory, plan laundry |
| Gamification | Gamify learning, habits, and other tasks |
| Learning | Visualize learning progress (dashboard), create community of learners, manage learning ressources |
| Anime  | Use anime UI/UX |
