# Stage 1 - Team Formation and Idea Development
This report is meant for providing an overview on the team formation
process, list the ideas explored and give a summary of the chosen
Minimal Viable Product concept.
## Team formation
Due to the personal motivations of the members of the Holberton School
cohorte of which I am part, most portfolio project "groups" are of
individual nature and such is also the case of this project.
### Involved roles
Projects of this magnitude typically involve the following roles:
- Team Members: Responsible for idea generation, development, and documentation.
- Project Manager: Oversees the project to ensure it stays on track
  with the plan.
  This role may be assigned permanently to one member or rotated among
  team members in each stage, allowing everyone to gain experience in
  project management.
  The project manager is responsible for organizing team meetings, monitoring progress, identifying risks, and ensuring deadlines are met.
- Team Lead: A leadership role within the team that may rotate as well, focusing on task coordination and technical decision-making.
- Tutors: Provide mentorship, evaluate deliverables, and offer feedback.
- Project Evaluators: Assess the final product and presentations based
  on the predefined rubric.
### Team member roles:
As I ([Xavier Laforgue](https://github.com/XavierLaforgue)) am the only member of my team I'll take on the roles of: team
member, project manager, and team lead.
The roles of tutor and project evaluator will, however, be taken on by
the local Holberton School Software Engineer: [Sacha Schoumiloff](https://github.com/SChoumiloff).
### Collaboration strategies:
Not strictly applicable given that I work alone.
However, daily standups with the other "teams" to share progress,
request help, advice, and feedback will emulate the collaborative
experience/environment. 
## Ideas explored
- Reading tracker, posting reviews.
- Health tracker: menstruation, blood pressure, etc.
- Anime-inspired recipe-sharing site, with time tracker integrated when
 preparing a recipe and nutritional information tracker.
- Gym tracker.
- Anime inspired personal improvement web app: gamify personal
  projects (medals, exp points), plot measurable progress, anime character delivering
  motivational phrases extracted from animes.
- Hub for boardgame players to find game partners in the city: create
  profiles with availability datetimes, create events, notify users
  that are available at that time, blacklist users.
- Home inventory web app. Create inventory of products in different
  cathegories (fresh food, long-lasting food, cleanning supplies,
  laundry, office supplies, etc). Keep track of exhausted inventories.
- Individual professional site. Online comprehensive CV with detailed information:
  html version of articles, plots, numerical data, calculations for
  chosen parameters, contact request, leave comment on ressource, etc.
- Personal finance planner / budget tracker: track expenses by
  categories and items, import data from receipts (supermarket, etc)
  analyse/visualize spendings.
- Collaborative study/work hub.
- Skill-sharing marketplace: a platform where users can offer and book
  lessons, collaborations, tutorials, peer-learning sessions (e.g.,
  music, coding, cooking, drawing, mathematics, science). Including
  scheduling, reviews, and messaging. Basically meeting up and working
  on something productive/educative.
- Language exchange platform.
- Habit Tracker with Social Features:
  Users set daily/weekly habits, track progress, and join public or private groups for accountability. Includes streaks, leaderboards, and motivational badges.
