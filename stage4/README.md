# Stage 4: MVP Development and Execution

Welcome to Stage 4 of the Portfolio Project! This phase is dedicated to building and delivering the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) by translating technical plans into a working solution through collaborative, Agile development.

## Objectives
- Implement the MVP based on the technical documentation developed in Stage 3.
- Adopt Agile principles to divide work into manageable sprints, ensuring iterative development and continuous improvement.
- Assign roles and responsibilities, emphasizing the importance of Project Manager, Source Control Manager (SCM), and Quality Assurance (QA) roles for project organization and quality assurance.
- Promote collaboration among team members with clear task assignments, deadlines, and dependencies.
- Monitor progress through metrics, address deviations from the plan, and prioritize deliverables effectively.

## Importance of Stage 4
This stage represents the most intensive phase of the project, translating plans and designs into a functional MVP.
Non-technical roles like Project Manager, SCM, and QA are vital to maintaining organization, ensuring the integrity of the codebase, and delivering high-quality results.
The adoption of Agile methodologies, such as sprints, fosters adaptability, consistent progress, and team alignment.

## Key Roles for Stage 4

1. **Project Manager (PM):**
	- Oversees planning, sprint organization, and progress tracking.
	- Coordinates team activities and ensures deadlines are met.
	- Manages deviations and adapts the plan as needed.
2. **Source Control Manager (SCM):**
	- Ensures proper use of version control (e.g., Git).
	- Maintains branch integrity, conducts code reviews, and enforces best practices.
3. **Quality Assurance (QA):**
	- Develops and executes test plans, including unit, integration, and user acceptance testing.
	- Ensures all deliverables meet the predefined quality standards before deployment.
4. **Technical Roles:**
	- Developers, database administrators, and other technical members responsible for implementing features, APIs, UI components, or other project elements.

## Tasks to Complete Stage 4

1. **Plan and Define Sprints**
	- Break down user stories into smaller tasks or features.
	- Prioritize tasks for the first sprint using MoSCoW (Must Have, Should Have, Could Have, Wonâ€™t Have) or similar frameworks.
	- Identify dependencies between tasks and assign them to team members.
	- Define the duration of each sprint (e.g., 1-2 weeks).
	**Deliverable:** Sprint plan with prioritized tasks, deadlines, and responsibilities for all team members.

2. **Execute Development Tasks**
	- Developers focus on tasks assigned for the sprint, adhering to coding standards and documentation requirements.
	- SCM ensures version control processes are followed, including branching strategies (e.g., feature branches) and pull request reviews.
	- QA conducts tests on completed tasks to identify bugs or improvements.
	**Deliverable:** Codebase on GitHub, including tests.

3. **Monitor Progress and Adjust**
	- Conduct daily stand-ups to review completed tasks, discuss blockers, and plan the day's work.
	- Use project management tools (e.g., Trello, Jira) to update task statuses and track metrics such as velocity (tasks completed per sprint).
	- Adjust sprint goals or reassign tasks as necessary to stay on track.
	**Deliverable:** Task and bug tracking.

4. **Conduct Sprint Reviews and Retrospectives**
	- At the end of each sprint, present completed features to the team and stakeholders.
	- Conduct a retrospective to identify what went well, what didn't, and how to improve.
	**Deliverable:** Web app version with completed features.

5. **Final Integration and QA Testing**
	- Conduct integration tests to verify the end-to-end functionality of the MVP.
	- QA executes the final test plan, including manual and automated tests.
	- Fix any critical bugs or performance issues identified.
	**Deliverable:** Completed functionning MVP and evidence of testing and results.

## Envisioned Activities for Each Sprint
- **Sprint Planning:** Define sprint goals, assign tasks, and set deadlines.
- **Daily Stand-Ups:** Short meetings to discuss progress and blockers.
- **Development:** Execute tasks according to the sprint plan.
- **Code Reviews:** SCM ensures quality and consistency through pull request reviews.
- **QA Testing:** QA tests completed tasks and provides feedback.
- **Sprint Review:** Demo completed work to stakeholders.
- **Sprint Retrospective:** Reflect on team performance and identify improvements.

<!-- ## Tips for Success
- **Focus on Communication:** Regular check-ins help maintain alignment and resolve issues quickly.
- **Use Tools:** Leverage project management tools (Trello, Jira) to track tasks and progress.
- **Be Flexible:** Adapt sprint goals when new challenges or opportunities arise.
- **Prioritize Testing:** Ensure QA is integrated into every sprint to maintain quality.
- **Measure Progress:** Use metrics like velocity and bug resolution rates to evaluate performance. -->
