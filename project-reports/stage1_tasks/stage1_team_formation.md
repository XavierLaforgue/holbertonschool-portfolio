# Portfolio project - Stage 1: Team formation & roles definition
## Team members
This is a solo project, therefore I ([Xavier Laforgue](https://github.com/XavierLaforgue)) am the only member of my team.

Due to the personal motivations of the members of the Holberton School
cohorte of which I am part, all portfolio project "groups" are of
individual nature and such is also the case of this project.
## Roles
I will work alone and embody the role of a solo developer.
As a solo developer, I'll take on the multiple responsibilities that concern carrying a software development project to completion:
- Project manager (create plan, monitor project progression, identify and mitigate risks, correct plan and ensure deadlines are met).
- Team lead (coordinate tasks, make technical decisions, design technical architecture).
- Team member (idea generation, development, and documentation).
- Fullstack developer (develop software components, leverage free and low-cost services to deploy the application and streamline its delivery).
- UI designer (produce applicaton mock-ups)
- Source code manager (document code, create integration tests).
### External roles
I leverage the fact of following the Holberton School web development program to assign some roles to other members of the program:
- Students developing their own portfolio projects will serve as brainstorming partners and sources of feedback during ideation and decision-making.
- The local software developer [Sacha Schoumiloff](https://github.com/SChoumiloff) will serve as tutor and technical advisor, therefore they will provide mentorship, evaluate deliverables, and offer feedback.
He will also assess the final product and presentations based on the predefined rubrics.
## Stakeholders
There are two main stakeholders: the pedagogical team and myself (both with a vested interest in the success of this project).
## Collaboration strategies:
Not strictly applicable given that I work alone.
However, daily standups with the other "teams" to share progress,
request help, advice, and feedback will emulate the collaborative
experience/environment.
As means of communication with my tutor, Discord and in-person
discussions are expected on a regular basis.
Regular check-in's with other members of the pedagogical staff are expected in a weekly basis.
