# Stage 2: Project Charter Development

Welcome to Stage 2 of the Portfolio Project! In this phase, a
structured Project Charter will be created to lay the foundation for all subsequent
work.

## Objectives
- Introduce the basics of project management by creating a simple yet structured project document.
- Define the project's purpose, objectives, scope, and key elements at a high level.
- Identify and document stakeholders, roles, risks, and other critical aspects.
- Outline a high-level project plan that demonstrates how the project will progress through its various stages.

## Importance of Stage 2
The Project Charter establishes a shared understanding of the project among team members and stakeholders. It serves as a reference point for decision-making throughout the project lifecycle and helps:
- Structure and formalize project information.
- Develop clarity on what needs to be accomplished and why.
- Gain experience in identifying risks and roles, crucial for effective project execution.

## Tasks to Complete Stage 2
Each task corresponds to a section of the Project Charter:

1. **Define Project Objectives**
	- Articulate the project's purpose and what it aims to achieve.
	- Identify 2-3 specific objectives for the MVP (e.g., solve a user problem, introduce innovation, improve an existing solution).

2. **Identify Stakeholders and Team Roles**
	- List all stakeholders: internal (team members) and external (instructors, users, partners).
	- Define team roles (Project Manager, Team Lead, Developer) and assign responsibilities.

3. **Define Scope**
	- Describe what the project will deliver (in-scope) and what it will not (out-of-scope).

4. **Identify Risks**
	- Brainstorm potential risks (technology, timelines, team dynamics).
	- Suggest mitigation strategies for each risk.

5. **Develop a High-Level Plan**
	- Outline the major phases and milestones of the project.
	- Create a simple timeline mapping out the stages and key deliverables.

## Deliverable: The Project Charter
The Project Charter should include:
- **Project Objectives:** Purpose and 2-3 SMART objectives.
- **Stakeholders and Roles:** List of all stakeholders and team roles.
- **Scope:** In-scope and out-of-scope items.
- **Risks:** Potential risks and mitigation strategies.
- **High-Level Plan:** Timeline or phases of the project.

## Expected Outcome
By the end of this stage, we should have:
- A clear and structured Project Charter document.
- Defined objectives, stakeholders, scope, risks, and a high-level plan.
- A solid foundation for the technical and development phases ahead.
