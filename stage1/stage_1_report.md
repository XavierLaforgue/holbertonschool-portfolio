# Stage 1 - Team Formation and Idea Development
This report is meant for providing an overview on the team formation
process, list the ideas explored and give a summary of the chosen
Minimal Viable Product concept.
## Team formation
Due to the personal motivations of the members of the Holberton School
cohorte of which I am part, most portfolio project "groups" are of
individual nature and such is also the case of this project.
### Involved roles
Projects of this magnitude typically involve the following roles:
- Team Members: Responsible for idea generation, development, and documentation.
- Project Manager: Oversees the project to ensure it stays on track
  with the plan.
  This role may be assigned permanently to one member or rotated among
  team members in each stage, allowing everyone to gain experience in
  project management.
  The project manager is responsible for organizing team meetings, monitoring progress, identifying risks, and ensuring deadlines are met.
- Team Lead: A leadership role within the team that may rotate as well, focusing on task coordination and technical decision-making.
- Tutors: Provide mentorship, evaluate deliverables, and offer feedback.
- Project Evaluators: Assess the final product and presentations based
  on the predefined rubric.
### Team member roles:
As I ([Xavier Laforgue](https://github.com/XavierLaforgue)) am the only member of my team I'll take on the roles of: team
member, project manager, and team lead.
The roles of tutor and project evaluator will, however, be taken on by
the local Holberton School Software Engineer: [Sacha Schoumiloff](https://github.com/SChoumiloff).
### Collaboration strategies:
Not strictly applicable given that I work alone.
However, daily standups with the other "teams" to share progress,
request help, advice, and feedback will emulate the collaborative
experience/environment.
As means of communication with my tutor, Slack and in-person
discussions are expected on a regular basis.
## Ideas explored
The first brainstorming method I took on was *brainwriting*, the
following is the list of ideas I came up with:
- **Anime inspired personal improvement web app**: gamify personal
  projects (medals, exp points), plot measurable progress, anime character delivering
  motivational phrases extracted from animes.
- **Reading tracker/personal book-centered blog**: create user, create
  blogpost per reading session.
- **Health tracker**: weight, sleep time, blood pressure, meditation
  session, habit formation.
- **Anime-inspired recipe-sharing site**: create users, create recipes,
  create time tracker per cooking step when
 preparing a recipe, create nutritional information of ingredients,
 meal planning, track meals and their nutritional content.
- **Gym tracker**: create users, create exercises, track and store
  exercice instances.
- **Hub for boardgame players to find game partners in the city**: create
  profiles with availability datetimes, create events, notify users
  that are available at that time, blacklist users.
- **Home inventory web app**: create inventory of products in different
  cathegories (fresh food, long-lasting food, cleanning supplies,
  laundry, office supplies, etc). Keep track of exhausted inventories.
- **Individual professional site**: online comprehensive CV with
  detailed information, i.e., web page version of articles, plots, numerical data, calculations for
  chosen parameters; the site allows contact requests and to leave comments on ressources.
- **Personal finance planner / budget tracker**: track expenses by
  categories and items, import data from receipts (supermarket)
  analyse/visualize spendings.
- **Collaborative study/work hub**: create users, create subject or (short-)project,
  make explicit what kind of collaboration you are looking for, match
  availabilities and interests of user profiles.
- **Skill-sharing marketplace**: a platform where users can offer and book
  lessons, collaborations, tutorials, peer-learning sessions (e.g.,
  music, coding, cooking, drawing, mathematics, science). Including
  scheduling, reviews, and messaging. Basically meeting up and working
  on something productive/educative.
- **Language exchange platform**: create user profile and share what
  languages the user wants to learn and which they are willing to offer.
- **Habit tracker with social features**: users set daily/weekly
  habits, track progress, and join public or private groups for
  accountability. Includes streaks, leaderboards, and motivational
  badges.
