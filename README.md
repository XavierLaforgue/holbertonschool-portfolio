# Portfolio project - Holberton School
Final project for the Holberton School's web developer program.

In the scope of this program, its students are required to carry out a project in its entirety: from ideation to delivery of the completed web-based software product.
As one of the students, I will develop, publish, and document all stages of my portfolio project in this repository.

## Stage 1: Team formation, brainstorming, and MVP

## Stage 2
## Stage 3
## Stage 4
## Stage 5
