# Stage 1 - Team Formation and Idea Development
This report is meant for providing an overview on the team formation
process, list the ideas explored and give a summary of the chosen
Minimal Viable Product concept.
## Team formation
Due to the personal motivations of the members of the Holberton School
cohorte of which I am part, most portfolio project "groups" are of
individual nature and such is also the case of this project.
### Involved roles
Projects of this magnitude typically involve the following roles:
- Team Members: Responsible for idea generation, development, and documentation.
- Project Manager: Oversees the project to ensure it stays on track
  with the plan.
  This role may be assigned permanently to one member or rotated among
  team members in each stage, allowing everyone to gain experience in
  project management.
  The project manager is responsible for organizing team meetings, monitoring progress, identifying risks, and ensuring deadlines are met.
- Team Lead: A leadership role within the team that may rotate as well, focusing on task coordination and technical decision-making.
- Tutors: Provide mentorship, evaluate deliverables, and offer feedback.
- Project Evaluators: Assess the final product and presentations based
  on the predefined rubric.
### Team member roles:
As I ([Xavier Laforgue](https://github.com/XavierLaforgue)) am the only member of my team I'll take on the roles of: team
member, project manager, and team lead.
The roles of tutor and project evaluator will, however, be taken on by
the local Holberton School Software Engineer: [Sacha Schoumiloff](https://github.com/SChoumiloff).
### Collaboration strategies:
Not strictly applicable given that I work alone.
However, daily standups with the other "teams" to share progress,
request help, advice, and feedback will emulate the collaborative
experience/environment.
As means of communication with my tutor, Slack and in-person
discussions are expected on a regular basis.
## Ideas explored
The first brainstorming method I took on was *brainwriting*, the
following is the list of ideas I came up with:
- **Anime-inspired recipe-sharing site**: create users, create recipes,
  create time tracker per cooking step when
 preparing a recipe, create nutritional information of ingredients,
 meal planning, track meals and their nutritional content. Integrated
 shopping list.
- **Anime inspired personal improvement web app**: gamify personal
  projects (medals, exp points), plot measurable progress, anime character delivering
  motivational phrases extracted from animes.
- **Individual professional site**: online comprehensive CV with
  detailed information, i.e., web page version of articles, plots, numerical data, calculations for
  chosen parameters; the site allows contact requests and to leave
  comments on ressources.
- **Hub for boardgame players to find game partners in the city**: create
  profiles with availability datetimes, create events, notify users
  that are available at that time, blacklist users.
- **Collaborative study/work hub**: create users, create subject or (short-)project,
  make explicit what kind of collaboration you are looking for, match
  availabilities and interests of user profiles.
- **Reading tracker/personal book-centered blog**: create user, create
  blogpost per reading session.
- **Health tracker**: weight, sleep time, blood pressure, meditation
  session, habit formation.
- **Gym tracker**: create users, create exercises, track and store
  exercice instances.
- **Home inventory web app**: create inventory of products in different
  cathegories (fresh food, long-lasting food, cleanning supplies,
  laundry, office supplies, etc). Keep track of exhausted inventories.
- **Personal finance planner / budget tracker**: track expenses by
  categories and items, import data from receipts (supermarket)
  analyse/visualize spendings.
- **Skill-sharing marketplace**: a platform where users can offer and book
  lessons, collaborations, tutorials, peer-learning sessions (e.g.,
  music, coding, cooking, drawing, mathematics, science). Including
  scheduling, reviews, and messaging. Basically meeting up and working
  on something productive/educative.
- **Language exchange platform**: create user profile and share what
  languages the user wants to learn and which they are willing to offer.
- **Habit tracker with social features**: users set daily/weekly
  habits, track progress, and join public or private groups for
  accountability. Includes streaks, leaderboards, and motivational
  badges.
## Short-listed ideas:
Some ideas appealed to me more than others, I'll proceed to evaluate
their strengths, weaknesses, and reasons for rejection.
### Anime-inspired recipe-sharing site:
#### Strengths:
- Excite the curiousity of cooking enthusiasts
- Exotic nature of the recipes
- Novelty of the website concept
- Useful for meal planning
- Well-established fanbase (anime fans)
#### Weaknesses:
- The exotic nature of the meals limits its public
- Some ingredients may be difficult to find
- Recipes may be difficult to follow
- Depends on user-generated content
#### Solves:
Meal planning and boredom related to meal prepping.
### Anime inspired personal improvement web app
#### Strengths:
- Potentially high impact
- Strong demand for motivational/tracking apps
- Anime spin differentiates from others
#### Weaknesses:
- Typically a mobile app
- A lot of work/planning to prepare the projects
- Conceptually difficult as it needs to give users enough freedom to
  customize their projects or it becomes useless
- Unclear what may work as reward once objectives are achieved
- Technically complicated to implement
#### Solves:
Organization and tracking of personal goals for motivational purposes.
#### Reasons for rejection:
Too many unknowns regarding the sort of projects that should be
included and how to generalize the project creation so users can
freely design their own. 
### Individual professional site
#### Strengths:
- Highlights professionalism
- Personalized presentation of professional experiences and portfolio
  of realized projects
#### Weaknesses:
- No much different than LinkedIn and without social features
#### Reasons for rejection:
- Boring
## Selected MVP Concept
I chose the **Anime-inspired recipe-sharing site**.
### Summary of chosen MVP
A website where users can create an account and search for or share anime-inspired
recipes.
Each recipe will dispose of step-by-step instructions, with or without
images for each step and a timer when one is necessary.
The quantities will be adapted according to the desired number of
portions and the nutritional information will be optionally available.
A meal planner and the possibility to export the corresponding shopping
list may be implemented.
#### Rationale
Anime has currently a large fanbase, a fanbase in adulthood, facing
adult challenges such as preparing meals that are healthy and tasty
while also avoiding boredom/repetition.
This website could help tackle this issue by offering interesting and
community approved recipes.
#### Potential impact
A community of curious anime fans wanting to experiment and create new
recipes inspired by their favorite shows may emerge.
Anime fans might be coherced to cook at home more often.
